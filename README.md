# Lullaby

Lullaby was my CS50 final project during the fall 2017 semester. I worked with a partner to design and build it over the course of a few weeks, and the end product was an iOS app that allows the user to play a combination of sounds and tracks the user's sleep data. See https://ide.cs50.io/lucyli1/cs50-final for project files, and visit https://youtu.be/zClcn-haMOU for a video demo.
